                <p>
                    The idea of The Travelling Book is simple & nothing new. We live in an age where people are obsessed about knowing everything and standing up for what they believe in.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, with the social media and decrease in the popularity of physical books, new generations are being distracted with a huge amount of irrelevant information and are kept in the dark with regards to certain social issues and such.                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Since everyone loves a nice surprise - we decided to leave books around Pennsylvania and particularly in popular spots in Philly where we can guarantee a big audience. We carefully choose insightful books that discuss social issues relevant to our history and current world.                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        We compile useful resources about the topic discussed in the book and save them in an online folder that could be accessed through the QR code on the book. Once the lucky parent of the Travelling Book is done reading the book and all the resources, they can finally make it a little surprise gift for someone, and leave it somewhere to be discovered!                    </p>
